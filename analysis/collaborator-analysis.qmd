## Exercise: Explore, Clean, and Wrangle Data
```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
```

```{r}
lobster_traps <- read_csv("../data/Lobster_Trap_Counts_All_Years_20210519.csv")
```

Look at your data. Take a minute to explore what your data structure looks like, what data types are in the data frame, or use a function to get a high-level summary of the data youâ€™re working with.

```{r}
glimpse(lobster_traps)
```
